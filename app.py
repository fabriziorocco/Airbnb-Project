    " There are a growing number of apartments on Airbnb, and it can be very difficult for a new landlord to understand what the similar apartments are, how to price their own correctly and how to know what service is appreciated by the guests. "
    "To solve these problems, we have created a platform that landlords can subscribe to so that they can get suggestions and price-range based on similar apartments, and an idea of what services are valued by the customers. Our motivation is based on our interest to use multiple Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve those problems and to create a platform that Airbnb could offer as a paid service."
